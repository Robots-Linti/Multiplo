# MightyCore
An Arduino core for large, breadboard friendly AVRs, all running [Optiboot 6](https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot). Major libraries such as SD, Servo, SPI and Wire are modified to work with this core. Still, a large amount of third-party libraries often works without any modifications. 
<br/> <br/>
This core requires at least Arduino IDE v1.6, where v1.6.5+ is recommended. 
<br/>
An Arduino forum post for this particular core are located [here](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=379427.0). 
<br/> <br/>
If you're into "pure" AVR programming, I'm happy to tell you that all relevant keywords are being highlighted by the IDE through a separate keywords file. Make sure to test the [example files](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore/tree/master/avr/libraries/AVR_examples/examples) (File > Examples > AVR C code examples).
<br/> <br/>
If you're looking for a great development board for these DIP-40 microcontrollers, I got you covered! I've used the Arduino UNO for years,
but felt like some functionality was missing on the board. When designing this board I made sure all missing functionality was added. [The board can be bought on my Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/products/MCUdude/dip-40-arduino-compatible-development-board).
Read more in the hardware section below.

##Supported microcontrollers
* ATmega1284*
* ATmega644*
* ATmega324*
* ATmega164*
* ATmega32*
* ATmega16*
* ATmega8535*

(* all variants - P, PA, A. Select the correct version in the 'Variant' menu)


##Supported clock frequencies
* 20 MHz external oscillator
* 16 MHz external oscillator (default)
* 8 MHz external oscillator
* 8 MHz internal oscillator
* 1 MHz internal oscillator 
 
Select your microcontroller in the boards menu, then select the clock frequency. You'll have to hit "Burn bootloader" in order to set the correct fuses and upload the correct bootloader. <br/>
Make sure you connect an ISP programmer, and select the correct one in the "Programmers" menu. For time critical operations an external oscillator is recommended.

##BOD option
Brown out detection, or BOD for short lets the microcontroller sense the input voltage and shut down if the voltage goes below the brown out setting. For microcontrollers with an extended fuse (ATmega164/324/644/1284) there is a separate BOD option. To change the BOD settings you'll have to connect an ISP programmer and hit "Burn bootloader".

##Pinout
This core got two different pinout option. The default one is named "Standard", and is based on the original AVR pinout. The other one is named "Bobuino" and is basically an Arduino UNO pinout setting. This pinout version is great for using with shields or code that's written for the Arduino UNO, as the pin functions stays the same (MOSI on D11, MISO on D12, SCK on D13). Please have a look at the (`pins_arduino.h`) files for more info. Pick your favorite!</br> </br>

##Programmers
MightyCore adds its own copies of all the standard programmers to the "Programmer" menu. You must select the MightyCore copy of the programmer you are using for "Upload Using Programmer" to work with ATmega1284, ATmega324A, or ATmega164A.

##How to install
#### Boards Manager Installation
This installation method requires Arduino IDE version 1.6.4 or greater.
* Open the Arduino IDE.
* Open the **File > Preferences** menu item.
* Enter the following URL in **Additional Boards Manager URLs**: `https://mcudude.github.io/MightyCore/package_MCUdude_MightyCore_index.json`
* Open the **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...** menu item.
* Wait for the platform indexes to finish downloading.
* Scroll down until you see the **MightyCore** entry and click on it.
  * **Note**: If you are using Arduino IDE 1.6.6 then you may need to close **Boards Manager** and then reopen it before the **MightyCore** entry will appear.
* Click **Install**.
* After installation is complete close the **Boards Manager** window.

#### Manual Installation
Click on the "Download ZIP" button. Exctract the ZIP file, and move the extracted folder to the location "**~/Documents/Arduino/hardware**". Create the "hardware" folder if it doesn't exist.
Open Arduino IDE, and a new category in the boards menu called "MightyCore" will show up.


##Hardware
I've designed a development board for this particular core. I've added all the functionality I missed with the original Arduino boards, and added the original AVR pinout. 
Not all supported microcontrollers have the same pin functions, and differences are highlighted. The boards measures 8.0 * 10.0 cm (3.15 * 3.94 in)<br/>
The development board got some additional unique features:
* A voltage select jumper to run the microcontroller at 5V or 3.3V
* All pins are located at the same side of the board, making it easy to hook it up to a breadboard
* Possible to add both male and female header for the IO pins (and solder a row of male headers under the board for breadboarding)
* A JTAG header for programming and debugging
* A high voltage parallel programming header for programming and fixing bad fuse settings (pin compatible with the AVR Dragon)
* A potmeter for using as a voltage reference (e.g adjusting the LCD contrast)
* LOTS of 5V, 3.3V and GND points broken out, both male and female
* Socketed crystal, perfect for experimenting with different clock frequencies
* A Reset enable header to enable/disable auto-reset when uploading new code or opening the serial monitor
* PWM pins are clearly marked, and a lookup table can be found on the under side of the board (three '~'s - all microcontrollers, two '~'s - 164; 324; 644; 1284, one '~' - 1284)
* IO peripherals can be found on the underside of the board. No need to search in the datasheet anymore!
* Mini USB instead of the large USB Type-B plug
* The USB to serial chip is broken out on the underside of the board in a standard "FTDI pinout" for using the board as a USB to serial adapter, or for using an external programmer instead
* The rest of the hand shake pins (CTS, DTR, RI, DCD) in the USB to serial adapter are broken out for other applications, such as bit banging

##Minimal setup
Here is a simple schematic showing a minimal setup using an external crystal. Skip the crystal and the two capacitors if you're using the internal oscillator. <br/>
